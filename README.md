Smooth CSV reader
=================

This code is unfinished, random stuff to do:
 * More accessors onto the indexed implementation (for index instance)
 * Possibility to arbitrarily skip headers
 * Switch over to PHP 5.3 and better namespacing
 * Write a documentation
 * Many other stuff

The code is usable as-is but API will probably change.
